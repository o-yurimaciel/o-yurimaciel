# Hi! I'm Yuri Maciel.

### About me

I am 27 years old, and I'm in the 7th period of Software Engineering, with prevision to end in 2026.

I have experience with Fullstack development, with a special focus on Front-end. I'm skilled in many technologies, including JavaScript, Vue, React, and Angular. In addition, my essential skills include proactivity, high communication, and a solid commitment to teamwork.

My career goal is to be an agent of transformation, actively involving myself in product creation and solutions that impact positively on people's lives. I believe deeply in the power of technology to change the world and I'm compromised to play a role in this process.
